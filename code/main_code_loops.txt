- Take a single alignment:
	- Take a single model of sequence evolution
		- Use ModelFinder to determine the best model within that model category
		- Estimate an ML tree with that model of sequuence evolution
		- Estimate the constraint trees
		- Apply the mixture of trees method using +TR (branch lengths maintained across trees in mixture)
